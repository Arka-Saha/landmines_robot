# Autonomous Swarm-Based Quadruped System for Landmine Risk Detection & Hazard Marking
### Indigenous Military Technology
 
## 📌 Overview

This project presents an autonomous swarm of quadruped robots designed to identify landmine-prone zones using vision-based machine learning and collaborative swarm intelligence. The system assigns probabilistic risk scores to terrain regions, physically marks hazardous zones using fluorescent indicators, and generates real-time heatmaps for remote monitoring.

The objective is to reduce accidental exposure of civilians, wildlife, and field personnel in landmine-affected regions.
